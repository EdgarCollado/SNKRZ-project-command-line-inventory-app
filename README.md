# sneaker-retail-store-project-command-line-inventory-app

Project for Command-line Inventory Application
Build for a Command-line Inventory Application using all I've learned thus far about JavaScript and application development. It will be a tool that allows staff members to monitor a store's inventory. Employees have the ability to add new items, edit existing ones, view a list of items, view individual item details, and delete items.

Basic CRUD App
This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that manages a shopping cart. The application provides basic functionality to manipulate items in the cart, such as adding items, removing items, and updating item quantities.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
Prerequisites
